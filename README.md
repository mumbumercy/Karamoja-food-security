# Karamoja Region: Food Security & Agricultural Analysis 🌾

## Project Overview
This project analyzes agricultural production, population constraints, and overall food security across the Karamoja region of Uganda. By combining regional crop data with geospatial shapefiles, thi analysis identifies which districts are producing enough food to sustain their populations and which are falling behind.

## Tools & Technologies Used
* **Python (Pandas):** Data cleaning, feature engineering, and standardizing text cases for spatial joins.
* **Git & GitHub:** Version control and repository management.
* **Tableau:** Advanced data visualization, geospatial mapping, and interactive dashboarding.

## Key Visualizations & Techniques
To answer complex questions about the region's food supply, the following visualizations were built into an interactive dashboard:
1. **Geospatial Heat Map:** A filled map of Uganda highlighting the Karamoja districts, colored by total food production per person.
2. **Dual-Axis Combo Chart:** Compares Maize vs. Sorghum production across districts, utilizing a synchronized axis and an average reference line.
3. **Scatter Plot with Trend Line:** Examines the correlation between a district's population and its total food production in tonnes.
4. **Geospatial  Heat map:** A filled map of Karamoja showing food produced in tonnes per district.

## Key Insights
* **Kotido's Agricultural Dominance:** Kotido is the undisputed leader in food production for the region, producing vastly more Sorghum than any other district, ensuring high food security for its population.
* **Moroto's Vulnerability:** Despite being a major district, Moroto produces dangerously low levels of food per person, highlighting a severe risk of food insecurity that requires targeted intervention.
* **Population vs. Production:** The scatter plot reveals a general positive correlation between a district's population size and its food output. However, outliers exist where high-population areas are failing to meet the agricultural demands of their citizens.
